Welcome! I'm **Jin Xing**, an academic–practitioner working at the intersection of GeoAI, climate science and sustainable finance. Formerly Assistant Professor of Geospatial Analysis at Newcastle University, and now Advanced Analytics Manager at TD Insurance in Toronto, I integrate climate-risk models into capital-planning and ESG workflows. My current research investigates how physical- and transition-risk metrics can be translated into sustainable investment signals for Canada’s financial sector.

This website collects a short bio, selected publications, and project notes. 
Recent posts about my research will also be shared here.
